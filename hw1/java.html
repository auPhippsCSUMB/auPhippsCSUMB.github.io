    <h2>A (Brief) Description of JavaScript</h2>

        <p>
            JavaScript is the last of the three big web development languages commonly
            used for websites. Javascript is a scripting language that handles more
            complex elements of webpages. Javascript allows dynamic behavior in websites
            that was not possible before, meaning user interaction would be able to update
            elements of the webpage in a quick, live manner. All web browsers today have a JavaScript
            engine built in that can compile the code on the user's device. You will often
            see JavaScript used in more complex, interactable graphical elements (like web games),
            elements that update dynamically with user ineraction, and elements in a webpage that
            encrypts and sends data (such as forms).

                I have actually already added some JavaScript to all of the webpages
                in this little website. At the top right corner of your screen there is
                an icon that will change the theme of the website to be either dark
                mode, or light mode. Have fun!!
